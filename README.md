Repo for completing coding challenges from Codewars, Edabit, Codesignal etc.

The purpose of this is to practice language methods and efficient techniques, using <strong>test-driven development</strong>

This is helping to solidify my problem-solving processes, as I'm not simply diving in with a solution, but taking time to analyse my approach and finding new ways to solve problems, which helps me learn and improve by coding abilities. I will keep a log of different processes that I am following below.

1. View problem, think about a solution that you think will work, no matter how inefficient. 

2. Write tests for the code challenge in your IDE

3. Adapt solution according to tests (perhaps writing your tests brought up a few edgecases - write these down too)

4. Write down solution in pseudocode / code (depending on how confident you are with your knowledge)
