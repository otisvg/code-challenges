Repo for completing coding challenges from Codewars, Edabit, Codesignal, Exercism, Project Euler etc.

The purpose of this is to practice language methods and efficient techniques, using <strong>test-driven development</strong>

This is helping to solidify my problem-solving processes, as I'm not simply diving in with a solution, but taking time to analyse my approach and finding new ways to solve problems, which helps me learn and improve by coding abilities. 

Within each challenge repo is a README including my thought processes when solving the challenge.
