SchoolOfFish wants you to create a program that counts occurences of students names, by first alphabetic value.

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.
